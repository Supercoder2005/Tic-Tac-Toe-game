# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in Python! This is a simple text-based game where a player competes against the computer. 
The goal is to align three marks (either X's or O's) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid to win the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the computer with turns alternating between the player and the CPU.
- **Random CPU Moves**: The computer picks random available positions during its turn.
- **Winner Detection**: The game detects when a player has won (three marks in a row).
- **Draw Detection**: The game checks for a draw when all positions are filled and no winner exists.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with a welcome message and displays a 3x3 grid with numbers 1 to 9, each representing a position on the grid.
2. The player selects a position by entering a number between 1 and 9.
3. The computer randomly chooses a position from the available spots.
4. After each move, the game checks for a winner or a draw.
5. The game ends when either the player or the computer wins or when the game is a draw.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their marks (`X` for the player and `O` for the computer) on an empty position on the grid.
- The first to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all positions are filled and no one has won, the game results in a draw.
